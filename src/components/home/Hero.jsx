                Hey there, I'm Somtochukwu. A software engineering student at
                Aptech. Hitting my keyboard for a solution is something I'm
                passionate about, though sometimes I always try to outthink
                myself on a better solution before hitting my keyboard. I'm an
                aspiring backend developer who has dabbled in the ends of
                frontend web development for over a year, good enough to call
                myself one.
